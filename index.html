        <h3>An Over Veiw of Covid-19 Cases in the UK</h3>
        <p>The first chart tracks Covid-19 cases by UK region.</p>

        <h1>Additional Charts of Intrest</h1>
        
        <h3>Enviromental Economics</h3>
        <p>The top chart is displaying CO2 emissions in tonnes per capita globaly and for some of the worlds largest economies</p>
        <ul>
                <li><div class="chart" id="Chart3"></div></li>
            </ul>
        <p>We can see in recent years there has been a global plateau in carbon emissions. </p>
        <p>A contibuting factor to this is likely due to economies such as the USA and the UK's reduction in carbon emission, with other countries like china keeping CO2 emmisions at fairly constant levels.</p>
        <h3>What's causing this plateau?</h3>
        <p>The second chart looks at global renewable engery generation in an over lapping time period</p>
        <ul>
            <li><div class="chart" id="Chart4"> </div></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here we can see that since the early 2000's there has been a significant increase in renewable energy production. Where in March 2006 the G-8 Energy Ministerial meetings took place in Moscow and plans where outlined to advance clean energy sources like renwable energy and emissions free neclear power.</p>
