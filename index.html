        <h3>Environmental Economics</h3>
        <p>The top chart displays CO2 emissions in tonnes per capita globally and for some of the world's largest economies.</p>
        <ul>
                <li><div class="chart" id="Chart1"></div></li>
            </ul>
        <p>In recent years, there has been a global plateau in carbon emissions. </p>
        <p>A contributing factor to this is likely due to economies such as the USA and the UK's reduction in carbon emission, with other countries like china keeping CO2 emissions at reasonably constant levels.</p>
        <h3>What's causing this plateau?</h3>
        <p>The second chart looks at global renewable energy generation in an overlapping period.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><div class="chart" id="Chart2"> </div></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here we can see that since the early 2000s, there has been a significant increase in renewable energy production. In March 2006, the G-8 Energy Ministerial meetings took place in Moscow and plans were outlined to advance clean energy sources like renewable energy and emissions-free nuclear power.</p>
